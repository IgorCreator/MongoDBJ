6.1: Which of the following statements are true about replication in MongoDB? Check all that apply.

The minimum sensible number of voting nodes to a replica set is 3- CORRECT
MongoDB replication is synchronous
By default, using the new MongoClient connection class, w=1 and j=1
The oplog utilizes a capped collection- CORRECT

6.2: Let's suppose you have a five member replica set and want to assure that writes are committed to the journal 
and are acknowledged by at least 3 nodes before you proceed forward. What would be the appropriate settings for w and j?

w=1, j=1
w="majority", j=1- CORRECT
w=3, j=0
w=5, j=1
w=1, j=3

6.3: Which of the following statements are true about choosing and using a shard key?

1. The shard key must be unique
2. There must be an index on the collection that starts with the shard key- CORRECT
3. MongoDB cannot enforce unique indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key itself, 
or indexes prefixed by the shard key- CORRECT
4. Any update that does not include the shard key will be sent to all shards- CORRECT
5. You can change the shard key on a collection if you desire

6.4: You have a sharded system with three shards and have sharded the collections "students" in the "school" database across 
those shards. The output of sh.status() when connected to mongos looks like this:

	mongos> sh.status()

If you ran the query

use school
db.students.find({'student_id':2000})

Which shards would be involved in answering the query?

1. s0, s1 and s2
2. s0
3. s1- CORRECT
4. s2
